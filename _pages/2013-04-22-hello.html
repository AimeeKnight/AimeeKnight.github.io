<p>I'm Aimee Knight, a former figure skater and software developer at <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/" target="_blank">SparkPost</a> in Baltimore Maryland where I use Node.js and Angular to help build out email infrastructure for companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.  In 2014 I decided to go all out, and spent six months as a student in the fourth cohort of the <a href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/" target="_blank">Nashville Software School</a> where I focused on JavaScript, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Coming from a background in collegiate sports I'm highly driven. After my first degree, I spent a lot of time working with developers and in late 2012 my career path began to diverge. When a developer for my employer's site handed off their CMS to me saying "don't touch anything outside of this" my fate was sealed. My curiosity, coupled with  increasing frustrations from the surmounting code changes we were always needing, led me on a path of no return. I started to stay up really late so I could work on the site while (hopefully) no one was looking. Within a few weeks I was hooked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a former professional figure skater I have a tremendous amount of energy and grit. Outside of work, I'm a panelist on the <a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/" target="_blank">JavaScript Jabber</a> and <a href="http://angular-air.com/" target="_blank">Angular Air</a> podcasts, a co-organizer for <a href="http://charmcityjs.com/" target="_blank">CharmCityJS</a>, and an avid runner. I'm a type A personality, and I’m not at peace, unless I have a set of challenges in front of me. As a former bootcamper, I also really enjoy mentoring current students, and helping out at <a href="http://nodeschool.io/baltimore/" target="_blank">Baltimore NodeSchool</a>.</p>
