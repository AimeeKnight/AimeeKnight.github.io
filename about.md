I’m Aimee Knight, a former figure skater and software engineer at
[DramaFever](https://www.dramafever.com/). In 2014 I
decided to go all out, and spent six months as a student in the fourth cohort of
the [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) where I focused on JavaScript, Node.js, and Ruby
on Rails.

Coming from a background in collegiate sports I’m highly driven. After my first
degree, I spent a lot of time working with developers and in late 2012 my career
path began to diverge. When a developer for my employer’s site handed off their
CMS to me saying “don’t touch anything outside of this” my fate was sealed. My
curiosity, coupled with  increasing frustrations from the surmounting code
changes we were always needing, led me on a path of no return. I started to stay
up really late so I could work on the site while (hopefully) no one was looking.
Within a few weeks I was hooked.

As a former professional figure skater I have a tremendous amount of energy and
grit. Outside of work, I’m a panelist on the [JavaScript
Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/) and [Angular
Air](https://angularair.com/)
podcasts, a co-organizer for [CharmCityJS](http://charmcityjs.com/), Board
Director for [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/), and an avid runner. I’m a type A
personality, and I’m not at peace, unless I have a set of challenges in front of
me. As a former bootcamper, I also really enjoy mentoring current students, and
helping out at [Baltimore NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/baltimore/).
