I'm Aimee Knight, a former figure skater turned Software Engineer. My tech journey began in 2012 when managing a company CMS sparked my curiosity. Currently, I serve as an Architect for CDW's Google Cloud Practice where I drive Google Cloud adoption through emerging services evaluation and ensure solution architecture best practices across client engagements. With over a decade in the software delivery lifecycle, I've worked across frontend/backend development, infrastructure architecture, DevOps, and site reliability.

Prior to my current role, I was Senior Site Reliability Manager at Paramount Global, leading Kubernetes cluster migrations and managing multi-regional architecture for two Super Bowl broadcasts. My career spans startups in education, construction, and banking, plus roles at Warner Brothers Discovery and NPM, Inc. (acquired by GitHub). I hold a Bachelor's in Communication Management from UAB (Summa Cum Laude) and attended the Nashville Software School. I'm a [Google Cloud Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/profile/u/aimeemarieknight) focused on Application Modernization, certified in Generative AI on Google Cloud, and an International Keynote Speaker.

In the past I helped organized DevOpsDays Nashville and [CharmCityJS](https://charmcityjs.github.io/), was a panelist on the [JavaScript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/) and [Angular Air](https://angularair.com/) podcasts, and volunteered for [Baltimore NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/baltimore/). As a former bootcamper with a competitive sports background, I enjoy mentoring students and junior developers. I'm available for mentorship and consulting, including volunteer opportunities for suitable projects. Let's connect!
