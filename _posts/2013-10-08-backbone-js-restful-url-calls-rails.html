<p>Just some notes written down for my own reference. Enjoy them if you wish!</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">var BookModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
  urlRoot: '/books'
});

var BookCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: BookModel,
  url: '/books'
});</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Create (POST)</strong></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">var brandNewBook = new BookModel({ title: '1984', author: 'George Orwel' });
brandNewBook.save();</pre>
<p>Backbone sees I'm trying to create a new book and makes the following POST request received by the Rails router:</p>
<p><em>POST /books HTTP/1.1</em><br />
<em> Host: example.com</em></p>
<p><em>{"title":"1984","author":"George Orwel"}</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Read (GET) -- collection</strong></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">BookCollection().fetch();</pre>
<p>Backbone sees I'm trying to read a collection of books and makes the following GET request received by the Rails router:</p>
<p><em>GET /books HTTP/1.1</em><br />
<em> Host: example.com</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Read (GET) -- object</strong></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">new BookModel({ id: 42 }).fetch();</pre>
<p>Backbone sees I'm trying to read a single book and makes the following GET request received by the Rails router:</p>
<p><em>GET /books/42 HTTP/1.1</em><br />
<em> Host: example.com</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update (PUT)</strong></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">brandNewBook.set('author', 'George Orwell');
brandNewBook.save();</pre>
<p>Backbone knows 'brandNewBook' is in the database so it updates the book with a PUT request received by the Rails router:</p>
<p><em>PUT /books/84 HTTP/1.1</em><br />
<em> Host: example.com</em></p>
<p><em>{"title":"1984","author":"George Orwell"}</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Destroy (DELETE)</strong></p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">brandNewBook.destroy();</pre>
<p>Backbone sees I'm trying to destroy a single book and makes the following DELETE request received by the Rails router:</p>
<p><em>DELETE /books/84 HTTP/1.1</em><br />
<em> Host: example.com</em></p>
