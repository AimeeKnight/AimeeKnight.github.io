<p>I'm currently attending the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and had an interesting conversation this week with another student and my professor. Some students are new to JavaScript, and a few were introduced to the concept of scope for the first time which brought about obvious questions. Keep in mind, some of the students don't have experience in OOP yet either. Now, since I have programmed in JavaScript and Ruby I see scope in a functional sense, and can't help but compare it to encapsulation in OOP. A quick search of StackOverflow revealed a number of similar observations. Since I look back now and wish I would have started with Ruby I thought I'd try to explain scope by way of encapsulation. Here's the gist of my explanation:</p>
<p>"I'll try to explain this from the perspective of someone else who's somewhat new to programming. There's this other Computer Science term that sounds scary but really isn't that describes the whole 'local vs global' variable thing. That term, is called encapsulation. Just the term itself should help you understand the difference. In the case of the discussion in chapter 3, local variables are encapsulated within a function. Because those variables are encapsulated locally within that function, they can't be accessed from outside their encapsulation (i.e. the function). Global variables on the other hand don't have an encapsulation, so you can refer to them from outside, or inside the function.</p>
<p>In functional languages like JavaScript you will usually hear this described as, 'scope' which is synonymous with whatever abstract construct is encapsulating a variable. In this case, the function is encapsulating the variable. I won't go down too far of a rabbit hole, but sometime in the future you will learn that their are additional ways to 'encapsulate' variables in programming."</p>
<p>And from that sprung an interesting conversation between the class on whether or not a function could be considered an encapsulation. While my professor emphasizes (and I agree) the appropriate term in a functional language would be "scope", I can't help but bring in my understanding of encapsulation now that I've dug into Ruby. It will be interesting to see how my mindset evolves as I myself evolve. There certainly seems to be an array of differing opinions among us!</p>
