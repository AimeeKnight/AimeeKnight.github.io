<p>Now that I'm working on a larger code base, debugging has become increasingly important and complex. With that said, I decided to dig into some documentation, and explore how I can use tools that already exist more productively. Below are some of the tricks I've come up with so far.</p>
<h2>Chrome Dev Tools</h2>
<h4><strong>Console:</strong></h4>

{% highlight javascript %}
keys(window);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The keys method takes any object and returns its properties. Passing in window, is a great way to check for global variables.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
monitorEvents(window, "click");
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The monitorEvents method will print the event's object to the console. This one's pretty cool to play around with!</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$0;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Lost in a see of divs? This will print only the currently inspected element to the console.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$_;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I used this one in the past, but it had escaped me. The console is definitely not a replacement for a full editor, but with $_ you can easily retrieve the result of your previous command.</p>
<p>Speaking of an editor replacement, Shift + Enter acts as a return, allowing you to play around with methods, or anything else you'd need multiple lines for.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
Object.defineProperty(object, property, descriptor);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Descriptor is just an object. And, by defining a getter and setter that wrap debugger on that object, you can pause and inspect the state of your application whenever the property you've passed is read or written to.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
Object.observe(object, function(){});
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The observe method is pretty cool by itself, and using it for debugging is really useful. Use it to see whenever a new property is added to the passed in object.</p>
<h4><strong>Sources:</strong></h4>
<p>Need to find something specific in the sea of files? Cmd + Shift + P will open up a search box.</p>
<p>How about when you're trying to debug a minified file? Clicking the curly bracket icon in the bottom left of the file window will pretty print it for you. I was excited about this one!</p>
<p>Finally, the filter input is handy for filtering files by extensions.</p>
<h2>Node</h2>
<h4>Debugger:</h4>
<p>To start up the node debugger, you prefix your file name with debug. Then, navigate with the following commands once you've landed on your debugger statement;</p>
<ul>
<li>c - continue</li>
<li>n - next</li>
<li>s - step in</li>
<li>0 - step out</li>
<li>pause - pause</li>
</ul>
<h4>Console Object:</h4>
<p>(Although these are helpful with Node, they can be used in the browser as well)</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
console.dir();
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Passing an object to the dir method with output the object as json instead of the typical string.</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
console.trace();
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Unsure how your method is call is being initialized? The trace method is the right tool for the job.</p>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p>Maybe you were wondering about the json filter. The creators of Angular actually said that this is a technique they've used.</p>

{% raw %}
{{ apiResult | json }}
{% endraw %}

<p>Much nicer on the eyes.</p>
<h4>Batarang:</h4>
<p>I haven't played around with Batarang in depth, but just by adding the extension, you enter things like;</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
$scope;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>in the console, and see everything on that scope object.</p>
